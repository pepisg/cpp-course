# Modern c++ Course

This repository hosts my solutions to the [problems](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/teaching/cpp-2020/homeworks/) on the modern c++ for computer vision and image proccessing [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGRM59sr3nSL8BmeMZR9GCIA) made by [Cyrill Stachniss](https://github.com/stachnis) and [Ignacio Vizzo](https://github.com/nachovizzo) at the University of Bonn. They own all the credits for the problems formulation and material.

Thanks to them and to the University for posting this material and all the other courses online for free.
