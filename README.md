# Modern c++ Course

This repository hosts my solutions to the modern c++ programming [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGRM59sr3nSL8BmeMZR9GCIA) made by [Cyrill Stachniss](https://github.com/stachnis) and [Ignacio Vizzo](https://github.com/nachovizzo) at the University of Bonn. They own all the credits for the problems formulation.

Thanks to them an to the university for posting this material and all the other courses online for free.
